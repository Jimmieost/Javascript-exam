On this page, I have used Brewdog's Punk API to load beers and added information about the beers such as alcohol percentage, and more. The page includes a button that allows the user to sort beers by alcohol percentage and load more beers onto the page without the need to refresh the entire page. I have also created a shopping cart where users can add beers for purchase or simply save their favorites, with the price of each beer added being totaled.

The shopping cart can be cleared with a button, and there is a "purchase" button that displays an alert to the user, indicating that the order has been received, and then empties the cart. I've implemented local storage to ensure that the cart is preserved when the page is refreshed.
